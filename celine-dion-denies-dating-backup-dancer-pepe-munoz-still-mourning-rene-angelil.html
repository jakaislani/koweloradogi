However, TMZ’s source claims, “The relationship is completely platonic. Pepe’s a dancer on her international summer tour, and they know each other through mutual friends in Las Vegas.”</p><p>As for the photos? Well, Pepe Munoz is reportedly also a fashion illustrator in addition to being a backup dancer, and as such, has been trailing Celine Dion everywhere for his side gig. And since they have ‘shared interests’, it’s supposed to explain why they’ve been spotted all over Paris, especially as Celine’s tour has been following her everywhere.</p><p><a rel=nofollow href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebdirtylaundry.com/wp-content/uploads/GettyImages-678057916.jpg alt="Celine Dion Single - Not Dating Backup Dancer Pepe Munoz" width=500 height=332 sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p>With that being said, even if they’re close friends and they’re technically not in a ‘relationship’, that doesn’t mean that Celine and Pepe have nothing going on. <a rel=nofollow href=#>Publicists and sources are very, very careful with their use of language</a>, and even though this particular source claims that Celine is ‘single’ and not dating Pepe, it’s still possibly that they are hooking up or getting to know each other better. And just because they’re not ‘dating’ right now, doesn’t mean that they won’t be dating in the future.</p><p>It has been only a little more than one year since Celine’s husband has died, and as such, there should be time allocated to her grieving process. However, it’s normal and natural to move on after time, and Celine’s likely to move on with someone that she’s close to, someone that she sees often, and someone that she already has ‘shared interests’ with.</p><p>What do you guys think? <a rel=nofollow href=#>Will Celine Dion and Pepe Munoz end up dating</a> in the future, even if they’re not dating right now?
