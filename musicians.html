The lawsuit accuses Lizzo and the captain of her dance team of creating a hostile work environment during her 2023 tour, claiming the dancers were “exposed to an overtly sexual atmosphere that permeated their workplace.” The dancers claimed Lizzo sexually harassed and weight-shamed them, making sexually explicit remarks, encouraging them to touch nude nightclub performers, and demanding dancers explain their weight gains and eating disorders. “The stunning nature of how Lizzo and her management team treated their performers seems to go against everything Lizzo stands for publicly,” the lawsuit reads.
