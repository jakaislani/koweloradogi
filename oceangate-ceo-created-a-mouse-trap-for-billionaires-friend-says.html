He’s more famous now than anything else he would’ve done.”</p><p>“He quite literally and figuratively went out with the biggest bang in human history that you could go out with, and who was the last person to murder two billionaires at once, and have them pay for the privilege?” Stanley asked during the segment that aired Monday.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Karl Stanley, a close friend of Stockton Rush, suggested that the OceanGate CEO had a “death wish” that made him carelessly risk the lives of his passengers in order to go down in history. <span class=credit>60 Minutes Australia</span></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p></figure><p>When asked what he believed the fatal flaw of the Titan was, Stanley said: “There’s no doubt in my mind that it was the carbon fiber tube that was the mechanical part that failed.”</p><p>He even thought he heard that part cracking when he accompanied Rush on a test dive of the Titan in 2019 off the coast of the Bahamas.</p><p>During the two-hour, 12,000-foot descent, Stanley told “60 Minutes” that he recalled hearing “loud, gunshot-like noises … every three to four minutes.”</p><p>“That’s a heck of a sound to hear when you’re that far under the ocean in a craft that’s only been down that deep once before,” he added.</p><p>Stanley then sent Rush a series of heated calls and emails raising concerns that the noise was actually the Titan’s hull cracking.</p><p>“There is an area of the hull that is breaking down. It will only get worse,” he wrote to Rush in 2019, and candidly told his friend that he had a severe lack of operating experience, “60 Minutes” revealed.</p><p>“I literally painted a picture of his wrecked sub at the bottom [of the ocean] and even that wasn’t enough,” Stanley added.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Stanley blamed Titan’s “catastrophic implosion” on its carbon fiber construction, which he believes he heard cracking when he accompanied Rush on a test dive in 2019. <span class=credit>OceanGateExped/Facebook</span></figure><p>A <a href=#>video animation of Titan’s “catastrophic implosion”</a> posted to YouTube earlier this month also showed that the five passengers aboard the SUV-size vessel met their tragic end when the sub’s carbon fiber shell crumpled under the water pressure.</p><p>Titan is<a href=#>&nbsp;believed to have imploded on June 18</a>&nbsp;— less than two hours into its dive to the Titanic at a depth of about 5,500 feet in the North Atlantic.</p><p>If the sub had made it to the famed wreck, it would have had to withstand immense pressure at a depth of 12,500 feet below the surface, which is about 400 times greater than the pressure on land, the animation said.</p><p>All<a href=#>&nbsp;five voyagers aboard the submersible were killed.</a></p><p>Stanley’s “60 Minutes Australia” interview wasn’t the first time that Rush has been accused of recklessly leading what he knew would be a fatal voyage.</p><p>Patrick Lahey, president of Triton Submarines and a friend of late Titan passenger Paul-Henri Nargeolet, <a href=#>accused Rush of being on a “predatory” hunt for wealthy clientele.</a></p><p>“He could even convince someone who knew and understood the risks … it was really quite predatory,” Lahey <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">told the Times.</a></p><p>Another man, Jay Bloom — who nearly booked passage on the doomed Titan sub but pulled out over safety concerns — said Rush “wasn’t really looking to build a tourism business to the Titanic,” and only brought passengers along to “finance his scientific observation.”</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">OceanGate charged passengers $250,000 each to ride aboard the Titan. Rush has been accused of preying on his wealthy clientele. <span class=credit>Becky Kagan Schott</span></figure><p>“He wanted to research and document the decay of the ship over time,” Bloom said, noting that “multiple dives to the site costs a lot of money.”</p><p>Hence, OceanGate charged $250,000 per seat on the Titan.</p><p>Nearly a month after the Titan imploded and reports began emerging of its shoddy construction, <a href=#>OceanGate’s website went dark</a>, and the deep-sea exploration company scrubbed the internet clean of its digital footprint.</p><p>The Post has reached out to OceanGate for comment.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3R7j3BmanFfpLCmrc2gmK2dXZiysHnCq5yarJWZeqJ5zKisrJ1dqb%2BivIyfpqtlkp65rbXOp5iiqpWoeqe%2ByJ6lnWWjlsa0ew%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ByteZest - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
