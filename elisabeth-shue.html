Her first film was 1984's The Karate Kid. She followed up that success with the lead role in Adventures in Babysitting (1987). Shue was nominated for an Academy Award for the 1995 drama Leaving Las Vegas. More recently, she starred in the TV crime drama CSI from 2011 to 2015.</p><h2 data-node-id=3 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Early Life</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Born on October 6, 1963, Shue grew up with three brothers, William, Andrew and John, in South Orange, New Jersey. Shue was an athlete, competing with her brothers on the soccer field. She later became a gymnast.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">While a student at Columbia High School, Shue started her acting career. Her first part was in a Burger King commercial when she was 16 years old, and she landed more advertising work soon after. She attended Wellesley College after graduating from high school in 1981.</p><h2 data-node-id=7 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Popular Film Star</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 1984, Shue made her film debut in the box office hit The Karate Kid. She played Ali, the love interest of the title character Daniel (played by <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/ralph-macchio data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Ralph Macchio" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Ralph Macchio</a>), in the movie.

Shue suffered a tremendous personal loss around this time. Her older brother William died in an accident during a family vacation. Shue told Biography magazine that this tragedy changed her personal outlook. "What happened to Will taught me that human beings are fragile.

Shue told Entertainment Weekly that she "got lucky" when she landed this part. "If you're not a star, you usually don't even get to read for a role this complex and beautiful, let alone get it."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Shue won several awards for Leaving Las Vegas, including the Independent Spirit honor for best actress and also picked up her one and only Academy Award nomination thus far.

She and her brother Andrew, a former actor who found fame as a cast member of the popular 1990s TV drama Melrose Place, produced the independent film Gracie. The movie follows a young girl who loses her older brother in a car accident. She then sets her sights on taking his place on their school's soccer team.
