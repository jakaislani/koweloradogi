And if that is actually you (and I’m sure for some of you it is) you are in luck, because the flavors and packaging of the 2024 Summer Dew flavors just leaked this week. I’m here to tell you it’s gonna be red, white, and blue all over with three flavors of patriotic Mtn Dew, two new and one just waiting to dew what they dew best: get consumed by us, the people, of the United States of America.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-so-just-what-are-these-new-mtn-dew-flavors-are-they-red-white-and-blue-will-they-have-distinctly-american-flavors-like-apple-pie-hot-dogs-and-a-notoriously-difficult-to-navigate-healthcare-system>So just what are these new Mtn Dew flavors? Are they red, white, and blue? Will they have distinctly American flavors like apple pie, hot dogs, and a notoriously difficult-to-navigate healthcare system?</h2><p>Well, thankfully they will not taste like hot dogs, and likely won’t taste like those other two things either. What they will taste like is very on-brand for Mtn Dew. A new red variety (called Mtn Dew Star Spangled Splash) will taste like raspberry and strawberry. A new new white flavor (called Mtn Dew Freedom Frenzy) will taste like lemonade. And returning to stores is a blue Dew (called Mtn Dew Liberty Brew), which tastes like—and this is true—a “combination of 50 flavors,” presumably to celebrate the 50 states. How very American of them. All this according to soda news extraordinaire, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">@teamsupernovafb on Instagram</a>, who is not convinced that they really put 50 flavors in the Liberty Brew. That being said, it seems like we will have some pretty good flavors to choose from.</p><p>As for what the combination of 50 flavors business is all about, the last time Liberty Brew was <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">released in the summers of 2019 and 2020</a>, the brand never revealed the 50 flavors and it remains a mystery to this day. So naturally, I have to taste this when it comes out, and you can bet I will be dew-ing what I dew best—trying it and attempting to figure out what each of the 50 flavors are. In conclusion? Red, white, and blue? Don’t mind if I red, white, and (mountain) dew.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiroKS%2FrLHDZ5qopV%2BWv7W1wqWcaKaVrHquwM1mm56vXWd9c4CMn6Oarp%2BnwG68wK2poqeknrBuudOnZJ2dp2K7psPSaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ByteZest - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
