Others crush soda or <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">energy drinks</a>. Back in the day, I’d slam two Mountain Dews and a Camel Crush on my way to highschool. Yes, I was a teenage truck driver. Then there are the tea people. In the U.S., Canada, and U.K., when people are drinking tea, most of the time it’s black tea. No, that doesn’t mean tea without milk and sugar.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-what-is-black-tea-made-of><strong>What is black tea made of?</strong>&nbsp;</h2><p>Black tea is most often made from the leaves of a plant called Camellia sinensis. Green tea comes from the same type of plant. The difference is the leaves for black tea are allowed to oxidize before they are processed. Basically that means you pick a leaf from a plant and wait for the oxygen in the atmosphere to start turning it brown. The oxidation concentrates the flavor, which is why black tea has a stronger, darker flavor than green tea.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">English Breakfast</a>, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Earl Grey</a>, Darjeeling, and Lapsang Souchong are all varieties of black tea, and it’s particularly popular in the “West” (we’re talking the U.S., Canada, and the U.K.). When the Dutch began exporting tea from China in the 1600s, black tea was the obvious choice since it holds its flavor and stays fresh longer. So, that’s what the West received and it never looked back. Until the matcha craze hit. Then all bets were off.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/RANKINGS_BEST-EARL-GREY_JORDAN_HEADER-1170x658.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-best-earl-grey-tea><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Best Earl Grey Tea</a></h2><p>What’s the best Earl Grey tea? We tasted a bunch of the top brands on the market to find the best Ear Grey tea for your next tea time.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-how-do-you-make-black-tea><strong>How do you make black tea?&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>There are a lot of different kinds of black tea so there are a lot of different ways to make it. But the big question is, how long do you steep black tea? If you are having a cup of Earl Grey or English Breakfast, a good rule of thumb is to steep somewhere between 2-6 minutes. The tea will taste stronger and can become more caffeinated depending on how long you steep it and how hot the water is. So, it is really a personal choice. However, steeping too long can cause a somewhat bitter taste. Me personally, I just brew tea so I can spill it while I make <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Kermit memes</a>, but that’s none of my business.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-what-are-the-benefits-of-black-tea><strong>What are the benefits of black tea?&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>Black tea is like a dream job: It has a lot of really good benefits. Black tea has antioxidants that can protect us from some chronic diseases. But what is unique to black tea is something called theaflavins which develop during the oxidation process. Theaflavins may help lower blood cholesterol, promoting heart health. Also, drinking a moderate amount of black tea has been shown to possibly reduce the risk of stroke and some cancers, and lower blood sugar levels. It can also improve focus with its caffeine. Yes, black tea does contain caffeine, about half the amount of a cup of coffee. An eight ounce cup of coffee averages around 95 mg while the same amount of black tea clocks in around 47 mg.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiroKS%2FrLHDZ5qopV%2BWv7W1wqWcaK%2BYlsFutdJmmaWZk6B6tbHAaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ByteZest - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
