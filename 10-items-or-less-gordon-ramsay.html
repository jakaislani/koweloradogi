A series in which we create a 10-item-or-less grocery haul for our favorite food-loving celebrities.</p><p>This week, we’re shopping for the most feared man on cable TV: Gordon Ramsay. This British chef and TV personality loves to yell, so now I’m yelling at him about what I think he should be buying at the grocery store. These five items will keep his at-home cooking situation from turning into a kitchen nightmare.</p><p>I typically give people around ten items I’d buy for them at the grocery store, but Gordon Ramsay is a professional chef. He’s not cooking at home often!</p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Celestial Seasonings Energy Tea Black Tea</strong></a><p>Gordon Ramsay is a busy British man who is always screaming, so I have to give him <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">one of our favorite teas</a>. These fit his lifestyle perfectly because they’ll soothe his throat while giving him a boost of energy to continue screaming all day long.</p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Vermont Creamery Cultured Butter with Sea Salt</strong></a><p>Every professional chef I’ve ever worked with is a snob about butter. And rightfully so! Butter can really make or break a simple dish. Because of this, I’m supplying Gordon with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">our favorite butter</a>: Vermont Creamery Cultured Butter with Sea Salt. I can already hear him shouting at me about the fact that I should be buying him unsalted butter so I can control the salt, but I’m not interested! Remember, Gordon, this is for your home. This is a wonderful multipurpose butter that you could serve with bread or use to saute onions. Give it a chance! I think you’ll like it, chef!</p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Beecher’s “World’s Best” Mac & Cheese</strong></a><p>Gordon has been known to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">hate on frozen food</a>. Well, I’m hating on that! There are so many delicious frozen meals on the market that are easy, affordable, and tasty. I’m grabbing Gordon this frozen macaroni and cheese from Beecher’s. I refuse to believe that he could make a dinner as delicious as this mac and cheese in the amount of time it takes to microwave this. If he wants to prove me wrong, he knows where to find me (in the comments section of this article)!</p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Motor City Pizza Co. Supreme Detroit-Style Deep Dish Pizza</strong></a><p>Gordon Ramsay has a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">pizza restaurant</a>, so I want him to try one of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">our favorite frozen pizzas</a> to get some ideas for future pizzas! I know he typically does thin crust, wood-fire pies, but I think one bite of this Motor City Detroit-style pizza will have him considering more crust.</p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>TRUFF Hot Sauce</strong></a><p>Gordon Ramsay loves using truffles in his cooking, so I’m getting him a bottle of TRUFF Hot Sauce. This stuff is good. It’s a little spicy, super savory, and very truffle-y. It’s great on literally anything. I’d even put it on a beef Wellington (one of Gordon’s signature dishes).</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiroKS%2FrLHDZ5qopV%2BWv7W1wqWcaGlgYra1scysZKiqXaGytL%2BMoKarnJ%2BjerOtzKyYsmc%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ByteZest - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
