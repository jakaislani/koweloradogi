It is with a heavy heart that we share this news with you. Carolyn Owen, who is the daughter of OCP patrons Ed and Dee Owen, has supported the organization for many years and has purchased several OCP works over the years. Carolyn was able to contribute to the launch of the “Playhouse Play-House” Saturday events for the Nebraska Theatre Caravan because of her partnership with Susan Baer Collins.</p><p>During the colder months of the year, groups would visit Caravan to take in a performance, have lunch, and participate in a variety of workshops that included music, dance/movement, puppetry, and more! In recognition of her relentless advocacy for the arts, as well as for people with disabilities, as well as for unity and inclusion, Carolyn was presented with the Governor of Nebraska’s Arts Award in the year 2020.</p><p>She was involved with a variety of organizations, including WhyArts, the BLUE BARN Theatre, the Great Plains Theatre Commons, No More Empty Pots, Coordinating Neighboring Friends, Heartland Family Service, Habitat for Humanity, the Tri-Faith Arts Initiative, the Intercultural Senior Center, Urban Abbey, and Park United Methodist Church. Within OCP and the greater Omaha community, Carolyn’s presence will be sorely missed for a long time. On the following Monday, October 16, at 11 in the morning, her memorial service will be place at OCP. After the presentation, there will be a luncheon in the Owen Lobby.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiglZbDprrLsmSmnZ2kv6qty6xlnKedZLCivs6lsKdlkaOxpr7SqKVmp5Kewbat0bJkpaeenMGqucRmmaiZopl6rrHMm5yrZZ%2BberC5wKGYZpuforq2usitsGaonJbGqbvUrJxmoJGoerGt0qycnWWRrK66ew%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ByteZest - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
