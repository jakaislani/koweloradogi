In that one, two street performers—an Israeli singer (Rafaelle Cohen) and a German (Robert Stradlober), who stands around dressed like one of the hovering angels from “<a href=#>Wings of Desire</a>”—meet cute and find themselves gradually drawn to each other. <a href=#>Peter Chelsom</a>’s “Berlin Ride” stars <a href=#>Jim Sturgess</a> as a man who has come to Berlin to drink himself to death following a bad romance and who learns to live and love again. <a href=#>Massy Tadjedin</a>’s “Under Your Feet” is about a refugee worker (<a href=#>Keira Knightley</a>) who finds herself taking a young Arab child home with her while his mother is away, much to the consternation of her own mother (<a href=#>Helen Mirren</a>), who wishes that she wouldn’t try to take on all the problems of the world herself. <a href=#>Til Schweiger</a>’s “Love is in the Air” finds an aging American (<a href=#>Mickey Rourke</a>) trying to pick up a much younger fellow American (<a href=#>Toni Garrn</a>) in a bar and while I won’t reveal what happens from that point, the fact that the screenplay for this segment was penned by none other than Neil LaBute should alert you that happiness and good cheer are probably not just around the corner. On a much lighter note, “Berlin Dance” finds lost tourist <a href=#>Jenna Dewan</a> stumbling into an elaborate ballroom dancing fantasia complete with an appearance by the famed Palast Orchester.</p><p>As can probably be determined by its title, <a href=#>Stephanie Martin</a> and <a href=#>Claus Clausen</a>’s “Me Three” tackles sexual harassment as a group of women (Emily Beecham, <a href=#>Veronica Ferres</a>, Lili Gattyan and Phoebe Nichols) come together in a laundromat to discuss the various forms of abuse they have recently suffered at the hands of men and are then visited by the perfect embodiment of their rage, Dani Levi’s “Hidden” follows a refugee (<a href=#>Alexander Black</a>) who is on the run from the police after being attacked by a group of punks and who takes refuge with a friendly prostitute (<a href=#>Carol Schuler</a>). <a href=#>Diego Luna</a> plays the title role in “Drag Queen,” in which his character has a riverside meeting of the minds with a teenaged boy (Michelangelo Fortuzzi) who is questioning his own sexuality. “Lucinda in Berlin” finds <a href=#>Dianna Agron</a> pulling double duty as both the director and co-star, playing a winsome puppeteer who helps to rejuvenate a burned-out Hollywood producer (<a href=#>Luke Wilson</a>). In the concluding tale, <a href=#>Justin Franklin</a>’s “Embassy,” <a href=#>Sibel Kekilli</a> plays a would-be journalist who is reduced to driving a cab to make a living when a potentially big story literally lands in the back seat of her car.</p><p>The trouble with movies of this sort is that even when the stories are good on an individual level, the need to shift from one narrative to the next every 10-15 minutes can lead to a certain amount of frustration after a while. With “Berlin, I Love You,” the problem is compounded by the fact that most of the stories are not particularly interesting, either on their own or as part of a whole, and don’t really make much of an argument for the romantic aspects of Berlin. In fact, while most of the stories in the Paris and New York iterations were undeniably connected to their settings, the connection here is far more abstract—a number of the stories here could be taken out and reset in practically any other city in the world with only minimal changes to the material. The tone is also all over the place, as whimsical stories like “Berlin Ride” and “Berlin Dance” rest uneasily amidst the ones involving the plights of refugees and the Times Up movement. The latter is especially awkward as it lurches between honest truth-telling in its early moments to something broader and sillier that concludes, I kid you not, with a wacky dance party.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46bnKukmaN6qnnLqK2eZamkwm5%2Bj2pw</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ByteZest - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
