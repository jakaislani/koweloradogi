"They are my inspiration these days, what motivates me to go out and mingle. I always, always love interacting with them, taking pictures, hearing their stories," <a href=#>he wrote</a>.</p><p>He described the supporters, many of which were fans of his late son Michael, as the "best fans in the world."</p><p>"I mean it with all my heart. With love like this, his legacy will live forever. The love [they] show me is out of this world and warms my heart," he professed.
