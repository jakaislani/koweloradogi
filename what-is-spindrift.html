Here it is: “Spray blown by the crests of waves by the wind.” In other words, a spindrift is the refreshing drizzle of ocean wave droplets that hits you when you’re sitting seaside. Forget Corona’s “Find your beach,” this is a word as synonymous with the refreshment and relaxation of sitting by the sea as you can get.&nbsp;</p><p>My point is, Spindrift is a really good name! But I’ll admit that’s pretty much all I know about it. Let’s explore what this beverage has to offer.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-what-is-spindrift><strong>What is Spindrift?</strong></h2><p>According to their <a href=# rel=noopener>website</a>, “Spindrift is delicious sparkling water made with real squeezed fruit.” Basically, if you’ve never had one before, a Spindrift is like a <a href=#>seltzer water</a> but with a dose of fruit juice you wouldn’t find in your <a href=#>LaCroix</a>, Polar, or <a href=#>Bubly</a>.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-who-owns-spindrift><strong>Who owns Spindrift?</strong></h2><p>In what is quite a rarity for products you can buy in the grocery store, Spindrift is not owned by a huge conglomerate. While the company has partnered with venture capital firms like VMG Partners in order to secure funding, this Massachusetts-based drink brand is still its own company, at least as of this writing.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-does-spindrift-have-alcohol><strong>Does Spindrift have alcohol?</strong></h2><p>This is an understandable question given the proliferation of <a href=#>spiked seltzer brands</a> on the market in the past few years, and yes, Spindrift has gotten in on the trend. While the original line does not contain alcohol, the company also offers “Spindrift Spiked,” which has an ABV of 4% and comes in flavors like Pineapple, Blood Orange Tangerine, Grapefruit, Strawberry Lemonade, and Half & Half (essentially an <a href=#>Arnold Palmer</a>).</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-does-spindrift-have-caffeine><strong>Does Spindrift have caffeine?</strong></h2><p>Generally speaking, there is no caffeine in Spindrift—the exception to this would be Spindrift flavors utilizing tea, which contain a small amount of the stuff.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-does-spindrift-have-sugar><strong>Does Spindrift have sugar?</strong></h2><p>Most Spindrift varieties do contain sugar, though the website is quick to note, “Our unsweetened sparkling water lineup has no sugar added. The only sugar you’ll see on the label comes from real fruit we use.”&nbsp;</p><p>Incidentally, this has not always been the case, since Spindrift started as more of a soda company than a seltzer company. Originally, back in 2010, Spindrive included cane sugar. But these days, there’s no added sugar. Just sweetness from the fruit juice.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-what-flavors-does-spindrift-come-in><strong>What flavors does Spindrift come in?</strong></h2><p>Spindrift is currently available in Grapefruit, Lemon, Orange Mango, Raspberry Lime, Strawberry, Lime, Pineapple, Mint Green Tea, Half Tea & Half Lemon, Mango Black Tea, Nojito, Pink Lemonade, Strawberry Lemonade, Lemon Limeade, and new Peach Strawberry. There are also seasonal flavors: Cranberry Raspberry and Spiced Apple Cider.&nbsp;</p><p>Now you’re a Spindrift expert, even if you’re never sipped on one!
