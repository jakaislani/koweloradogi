He passed away. Over the course of that year, Geier received numerous tests and chemotherapy treatments.</p><p>The scans came back negative; therefore, in January 2020, he was able to stop receiving treatments. However, in October, it was found that the illness had spread to his liver, and he once again began taking chemotherapy.</p><p>Jason resides in Fort Recovery with his wife, Melissa and their four young boys. Jason and Melissa Geier and their families have been selected as the beneficiaries of our share of the 50-50 F for the New Year’s Eve celebration by Sawyer Overman Annual Wiffle Ball Benefit Weekend. Their intention was to assist the family with any medical costs or allow them to do as they liked.</p><p>Words fall short of expressing our grief for your loss, as we mourn with family and friends for this great loss. We are truly sorry to hear of the loss of this promising being. Please accept our condolences and may our prayers help comfort you. Please accept our heartfelt condolences.</p><p>Feel free to drop condolence messages and prayers for the family and friends of the deceased, as it will go a very long way at this difficult time of theirs.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmigkarAorrEsGWcp51ju6h7yZqqqKZdnLKqsdFmppuhpKqus8WMp5ywq12bvLPAjKucnKemmr%2B6ec6hoKhlnZa7brbArKanZZeatqa%2BjJ2gnpxdm7%2BwuYycmKeblad8</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ByteZest - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
