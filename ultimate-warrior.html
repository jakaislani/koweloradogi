He became an immediate star after his 1987 arrival to WWE, his rapid ascent punctuated by a win over champion <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/athletes/hulk-hogan data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Hulk Hogan" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Hulk Hogan</a> at WrestleMania VI in April 1990. Warrior saw his career dwindle to a close following multiple suspensions, though he later mended fences with WWE and earned induction into its Hall of Fame shortly before his death in 2014.</p><h2 data-node-id=3 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Early Years and Bodybuilding Career</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Ultimate Warrior was born James Brian Hellwig on June 16, 1959, and raised in Crawfordsville, Indiana. The oldest of five children, Warrior endured financial and emotional difficulties after his father left the family, and turned to football and weightlifting at Fountain Central High School to fill the void.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Quickly packing on muscle, Warrior relocated to Georgia in pursuit of a bodybuilding career and won multiple events, including the 1984 Mr. Georgia crown. He then moved across the country to train at the renowned Gold's Gym of Venice Beach, California, where he joined a fledging wrestling team that also featured fellow future WWE superstar Steve Borden, aka Sting.</p><h2 data-node-id=7 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Early Pro Wrestling Career</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In late 1985 Warrior and Borden turned professional together with the Championship Wrestling promotion of Memphis, Tennessee. Initially billed as the Freedom Fighters, the fresh-faced duo soon embraced a bad-guy image and overpowered competitors as the Blade Runners.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Warrior eventually went solo and jumped to the Texas-based World Class Championship Wrestling promotion, where he amassed a sizeable following as the Dingo Warrior.</p><h2 data-node-id=10 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">WWE Superstar and Champion</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Getting his shot on the big stage of World Wrestling Entertainment in 1987, Warrior completed his transformation into the tasseled, face-painted Ultimate Warrior, and quickly became a fan favorite with his cartoonishly chiseled physique, high-energy performances and intense, cryptic interviews.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Warrior's emergence as a superstar came at the inaugural WWE SummerSlam of 1988, where he demolished The Honky Tonk Man in 30 seconds to claim the intercontinental championship. He later defended his title against <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/athletes/andre-the-giant data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Andre the Giant" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Andre the Giant</a>, cementing his status as a top draw by hoisting and body-slamming his 520-pound opponent.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Warrior's rapid ascent climaxed with "The Ultimate Challenge" match against heavyweight champ Hogan at WrestleMania VI in April 1990. The upstart scored a clean win by way of his patented "Warrior Splash," the passing of the torch marked by Hogan presenting him with the championship belt and the two embracing in the middle of the ring.</p><h2 data-node-id=14 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Suspensions and Move to WCW</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Ultimate Warrior's title reign was short-lived, as he was upended by <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/athletes/macho-man-randy-savage data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action='"Macho Man" Randy Savage' class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">"Macho Man" Randy Savage</a> and Sgt. Slaughter at the January 1991 Royal Rumble. Although he exacted revenge on Savage a few months later at WrestleMania VII, a contract dispute with WWE chief Vince McMahon led to his suspension from the organization in summer 1991.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Warrior enjoyed a grand return to the spotlight at April 1992's WrestleMania VII, where he rescued his old rival Hogan from a beating by Sid Justice. However, WWE was then facing federal scrutiny over the proliferation of steroids in the sport, and the wrestler was again suspended that November after allegedly failing multiple drug tests.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">After making another dazzling return with a victory over Triple H at 1996's WrestleMania XII, Warrior again ran afoul of McMahon when he began missing events, resulting in his outright termination from WWE. He resurfaced on the roster of World Championship Wrestling in 1998, though his brief stint with the organization ended following a loss to Hogan at that year's Halloween Havoc.</p><h2 data-node-id=18 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Name Change and Post-Wrestling Career</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">He legally changed his name to "Warrior" in the early 1990s and sought to capitalize on the brand by way of a comic book and the launch of the Warrior University gym and wrestling school in Scottsdale, Arizona.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">He found a post-wrestling niche as a conservative blogger and speaker, though he was criticized for a 2005 engagement at the University of Connecticut that dissolved into a shouting match with several students, an episode that fueled the WWE-produced documentary The Self-Destruction of the Ultimate Warrior.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Warrior continued to film motivational videos, and later found another constructive outlet for his passions through painting.</p><h2 data-node-id=22 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Personal Life</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">After divorcing his first wife, Shari, Warrior met his second wife, Dana, at his Arizona gym. They went on to have two daughters, Indiana and Mattigan.</p><h2 data-node-id=24 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">WWE Hall of Fame and Death</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Following a near two-decade estrangement from his former employers, Warrior agreed to be inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame and to assume an ambassador role for the organization in 2014.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=26 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Taking the stage with his daughters at the Hall of Fame induction ceremony of April 5, 2014, Warrior acknowledged his run-ins with McMahon and his peers and the long journey back into the WWE family. He attended WrestleMania XXX the following night and then appeared at Monday Night Raw on April 7, the occasion highlighted by another emotional speech from the former champion.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=27 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Shortly after his family arrived in Scottsdale on April 8, Warrior collapsed from a fatal heart attack, ending the life of the WWE legend at age 54.</p><ul data-node-id=30 class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Birth Year: 1959</li><li>Birth date: June 16, 1959</li><li>Birth State: Indiana</li><li>Birth Country: United States</li><li>Best Known For: Ultimate Warrior was a professional wrestling champion and WWE Hall of Famer who thrilled fans with his immense strength and high-energy performances.</li><li>Death Year: 2014</li><li>Death date: April 8, 2014</li><li>Death State: Arizona</li><li>Death City: Scottsdale</li><li>Death Country: United States</li></ul><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=32 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">We strive for accuracy and fairness.If you see something that doesn't look right,<a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/contact-us data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="contact us" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">contact us</a>!</p><br data-node-id=33><ul data-node-id=35 class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Article Title: Ultimate Warrior Biography</li><li>Author: Biography.com Editors</li><li>Website Name: The Biography.com website</li><li>Url: https://www.biography.com/athletes/ultimate-warrior</li><li>Access Date:</li><li>Publisher: A&amp;E; Television Networks</li><li>Last Updated: June 7, 2021</li><li>Original Published Date: May 6, 2021</li></ul><ul data-node-id=38 class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Every man's heart one day beats its final beat.
