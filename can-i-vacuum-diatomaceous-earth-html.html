Because DE is a sand-based compound, it may be abrasive to vacuum cleaners that have filters. As a precaution, a shop vac or a filterless vacuum cleaner should be used instead of your regular vacuum cleaner to prevent damage to your vacuum cleaner.</p><p></p><h3>Is it okay to leave diatomaceous earth on my carpeting?</h3><p>Leave the carpet in place for as long as necessary. There is no need to remove the diatomaceous earth as long as you are not kicking up dust or coughing (which should not be the case if the product has been applied properly).
