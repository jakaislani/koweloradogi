Since then, so many of you expressed how helpful it was so I’m back here again with&nbsp;a fall version. I love this season because the produce is so beautiful and cozy… it all just makes me want to get into the kitchen and cook! To me, there’s nothing better than the smell of squash and onions roasting away in the oven.</p><p>We’re partnering with <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Wolf</a> to bring you these tips as part of their <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Reclaim the Kitchen </a>initiative. This topic is near and dear to my heart because I actually used to hate cooking… or rather I thought I hated to cook until I found my kitchen bliss.</p><p>It turns out I wasn’t alone. Wolf conducted a “State of Cooking in America” survey to pinpoint some of American’s cooking attitudes and behaviors so they can help provide solutions to the problem. These statistics may sound surprising to you, but I think it’s safe to say that we’ve all experienced them at some time or another:</p><p>– Nearly three in ten adults (28%) have spent more than one hour thinking about what to make for dinner, then ended up ordering takeout.</p><p>– One-fifth of adults would rather work late than cook.</p><p>– Nearly one-quarter of 18-34 year olds (23%) indicate not being able to put together a meal with what is in their fridge and pantry is a reason why they haven’t cooked even when they had the time.</p><p>In time, I’ve realized that putting together meals was not as overwhelming as I thought. Cooking at the end of a hard day was just the thing I needed – the act of chopping vegetables helped me relieve my stress, putting together colorful vegetables helped me feel creative, and then enjoying a home cooked meal with my husband helped me feel connected.</p><p class=p1><b>Now onto my fall game plan!</b></p><p>I’m going to walk you through my shopping & prepping strategy,&nbsp;followed by&nbsp;3 easy dinner ideas.</p><p class=p1><span class=s1><b>Step 1: Start with seasonal produce</b></span></p><p>I started with the beautiful vegetables pictured at the top of the post&nbsp;– sweet potatoes, squash, Brussels sprouts, broccoli, apples, kale, onions, and leeks.</p><p><span class=pibfi_pinterest><span class=xc_pin onclick='pin_this(event,"http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://www.loveandlemons.com/fall-weeknight-meal-planning-tips/&media=https://www.loveandlemons.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/IMG_2016_10_04_08567.jpg&description=Fall+Weeknight+Meal+Planning+Tips")'></span></span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1><b>Step 2: Stock up on some basics<br></b></span>These are things I generally try to keep in my pantry:</p><p>– Grains like farro or quinoa, soba noodles, or whole grain pastas<br>– Proteins like chickpeas, eggs, or tofu (or any protein you like)<br>– Pantry basics like olive oil, sesame oil, vinegar, tahini, maple syrup,&nbsp;and tamari<br>– Extras like nuts, seeds, and dried cranberries<br>– And a few fresh basics: lemons (of course!), limes, garlic, and ginger</p><p class=p1>&nbsp; <span class=pibfi_pinterest><span class=xc_pin onclick='pin_this(event,"http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://www.loveandlemons.com/fall-weeknight-meal-planning-tips/&media=https://www.loveandlemons.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/IMG_2016_10_05_08587.jpg&description=Fall+Weeknight+Meal+Planning+Tips")'></span></span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1><b>Step 3: Make a sauce to have on hand</b></span></p><p>I will commonly make a sauce once and use it over multiple meals throughout the week. I made a<strong>&nbsp;</strong>maple apple cider tahini sauce for&nbsp;the&nbsp;delicata squash grain salad, then I changed up the flavor by adding sesame oil and ginger for the next night’s soba bowl meal. The sauce can be made in advance and stored in the fridge for 4 to 5 days.</p><p><b>maple tahini sauce:<br></b><span style=font-weight:400>1/2&nbsp;cup tahini<br></span><span style=font-weight:400>2&nbsp;tablespoons apple cider vinegar<br></span><span style=font-weight:400>2&nbsp;teaspoon maple syrup<br></span><span style=font-weight:400>6&nbsp;tablespoons warm water, more as needed<br></span><span style=font-weight:400>sea salt and freshly ground black pepper<br></span></p><p><span class=pibfi_pinterest><span class=xc_pin onclick='pin_this(event,"http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://www.loveandlemons.com/fall-weeknight-meal-planning-tips/&media=https://www.loveandlemons.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/IMG_2016_10_05_08588.jpg&description=Fall+Weeknight+Meal+Planning+Tips")'></span></span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1><b>Step 4: Roast the vegetables</b></span></p><p>You can roast&nbsp;your vegetables all at once&nbsp;and store them in your fridge to have handy for salads and grain bowls throughout the week, or you can roast them as-needed for each recipe below. I prefer to roast as-needed for dinners and save the&nbsp;leftovers for easy toss-together lunches.</p><p>To roast: toss the vegetables with olive oil, salt and pepper and roast at 375° F until golden brown. The timing will depend on the vegetable. I also roast chickpeas while I’m at it – you should too.</p><p><span class=pibfi_pinterest><span class=xc_pin onclick='pin_this(event,"http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://www.loveandlemons.com/fall-weeknight-meal-planning-tips/&media=https://www.loveandlemons.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/IMG_2016_10_05_08593.jpg&description=Fall+Weeknight+Meal+Planning+Tips")'></span></span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1><b>Step 5: Make a grain to have on hand</b></span></p><p>This time I went with farro. I love this chewy, nutty grain for fall. I cook it like pasta in a pot of boiling water until it’s tender but still chewy and not mushy. Its&nbsp;cooking time&nbsp;varies greatly – sometimes it’s done in 20 minutes, sometimes 45. Just watch it and taste. Make a bunch and store the extra in the fridge.</p><p class=p1><b>And now here are 3&nbsp;simple meals that I put together that build on each other:</b></p><p><span class=pibfi_pinterest><span class=xc_pin onclick='pin_this(event,"http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://www.loveandlemons.com/fall-weeknight-meal-planning-tips/&media=https://www.loveandlemons.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/IMG_2016_10_04_08577.jpg&description=Fall+Weeknight+Meal+Planning+Tips")'></span></span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1><b>1.

Farro Fried Rice</b></span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>This is a great way to use up leftover farro from recipe #1.</span></p><p>Heat oil in a medium skillet, add sliced leeks and a pinch of salt and sauté until soft. Add shredded Brussels sprouts and cook until soft and golden. Add minced garlic, ginger and rice vinegar and toss. Add the farro, a drizzle of tamari (or soy sauce). Cook until warmed through and season to taste. Serve with a fried egg, chopped green onions&nbsp;and sriracha on the side. (alternatively, you could mix a scrambled egg into your fried rice). <a href=#>Click to see the full recipe.</a></p><p>For more handy kitchen tips, recipes, and inspiration visit:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">reclaimthekitchen.com</a></p><p class=p1>This post is sponsored by <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Wolf, </a>thank you for supporting the sponsors that keep us cooking!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbvVnpinnJyaurC60meaqKVfm66tuIywnJ6jnp60qcCMppyapF2luaK6zaKloGWknr20ew%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ByteZest - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
