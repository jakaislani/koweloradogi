What fans might not know is that for Anderson-Emmons' work on the show, she took home <a href=#>three Screen Actors Guild Awards</a> (which she shared with the rest of the cast) as well as a heck of a lot of money. While she joined Modern Family in 2011, two years after it premiered, she still did pretty darn well for herself. "For several seasons, Aubrey's salary per episode was $35,000," according to <a href=#>Celebrity Net Worth</a>.

Beyond that, she turned some heads by going viral on <a href=#>TikTok</a> thanks to her impressive lip-syncing skills while jamming out to Kanye West. It's that kind of attention-grabbing ability that's helped her earn a fortune that already sits at $6 million.</p><p>However, if life in Hollywood doesn't pan out in the long run, Anderson-Emmons can rest assured knowing that her father, Kent Emmons, could always sell his $12 million Smokey Mountain Castle in Tennessee. The (in)famous building "has been the subject of mystery and intrigue since the moment its construction first began [in the 1960s] and has been the centerpiece of numerous books, articles, and television segments," according to its <a href=#>website</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmbG1jbYJxe8eormalpZi1bq3RnmStoJViwLWt0axkqJ5dorylsdGnZJ%2BZnZ65unnWqKmtoF8%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ByteZest - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
