Blue Beetle is bringing with it a few collectibles that pop culture fans wonâ€™t want to miss getting their hands on.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=280 data-current-count=280 data-injectable=false>Movie-goers know that one of the best parts of the theater experience is grabbing your favorite drink and popcorn to sit down with before the show. With many significant releases such as Barbie and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Transformers</a>, themed buckets and cups make going to the movies even more exciting.</p><p data-characters=142 data-current-count=422 data-injectable=true>Blue Beetle is bringing the heat for excited fans, and we have to say, their themed bucket is one of the best weâ€™ve seen in a long time.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-where-can-you-get-the-blue-beetle-bucket data-injectable=false>Where can you get the Blue Beetle bucket?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>Alllllll the <a href=#>#BlueBeetle</a> merch ðŸ¤©</p><p>Now available at select theatres while supplies last! <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/D1nWcJnwlE</a></p>â€” Cinemark Theatres (@Cinemark) <a href=#>August 1, 2023</a></figure><p data-characters=561 data-current-count=861 data-injectable=true>The Blue Beetle popcorn bucket is currently available at Cinemark theaters, and while the movie doesnâ€™t release until Aug. 18, we recommend getting your hands on one sooner than later. Merch for major releases usually sells out rather quickly, and youâ€™re not often guaranteed another chance at getting what your heart desires. Coming from someone who nearly drove an hour and a half for the Haunted Mansion popcorn bucket and decided against it â€” only to ding out they were sold out the following morning; trust me on this one, you will regret it.</p><p data-characters=368 data-current-count=368 data-injectable=false>In addition to a literal blue beetle popcorn bucket, there are also cups and another version of a container that you can purchase, and the most adorable plushie that youâ€™ll absolutely want to get your hands on as well. Cinemark says that the merch is available at specific theaters now, so you may want to phone your local theater before traveling to pick it up.</p><p data-characters=301 data-current-count=669 data-injectable=true>If you do miss the items in your area, donâ€™t fret. After visiting our Cinemark location this weekend to check on that popcorn bucket again, an employee let me know that thereâ€™s a website where some <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">movie merch will be available for purchase</a>; so be sure to keep your eyes peeled there, too.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>What is Blue Beetle about?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=238 data-current-count=538 data-injectable=true>The upcoming superhero film will soon be taking us on a grand adventure, but just what is Blue Beetle about?
